# Fix_It - GitHub Issue Aggregator

## Project Overview

Fix_It is a React application built with Vite, providing a streamlined solution for managing GitHub issues. The application aggregates GitHub issues in one place, eliminating the need to navigate to GitHub each time you search for good first issues. With a clean and minimal setup, Fix_It leverages Vite for fast development, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and two official plugins, [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) for Fast Refresh using Babel, and [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) for Fast Refresh using SWC.
